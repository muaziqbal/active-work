# <%=config[:constant_name]%>

Welcome to your new agent gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/<%=config[:namespaced_path]%>`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

This gem is run as part of the [ActiveWorkflow](https://github.com/automaticmode/active_workflow) project.

Add this string to your ActiveWorkflow's .env `ADDITIONAL_GEMS` configuration:

```ruby
<%=config[:gem_name]%>
# when only using this agent gem it should look like this:
ADDITIONAL_GEMS=<%=config[:gem_name]%>
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

Running `rake` will clone and set up ActiveWorkflow in `spec/active_workflow` to run the specs of the Gem in ActiveWorkflow as if they would be build-in Agents. The desired ActiveWorkflow repository and branch can be modified in the `Rakefile`:

```ruby
ActiveWorkflowAgent.load_tasks(branch: '<your branch>', remote: 'https://github.com/<github user>/active_workflow.git')
```

Make sure to delete the `spec/active_workflow` directory and re-run `rake` after changing the `remote` to update the ActiveWorkflow source code.

After the setup is done `rake spec` will only run the tests, without cloning the ActiveWorkflow source again.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
